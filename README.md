Hi and welcome to my code test repo!

The project is pretty much complete, and there are a couple of things to note:
* I used default fonts since the ones you've specified cost money
* It doesn't look 'exactly' like the mockup, and I am not sure why. Sometimes It felt like some css rules were missing (shadow property specified for one component, but not mentioned for another). In any case, I was just following instructions.
* I looked into adding unit test coverage, but the tests were breaking in the MERN starter project itself - something in node_modules. I guess, there was an problem with dependencies versions, and for me it wasn't worth the effort.
